When a legal or semi-legal tribunal consists of only two members, neither one of them canperform an affirmative act changing, or which may change, an existing condition; or it takes themajority of the whole body to do this, and one is not a majority of two. Creamer v. 12 CommonPleas Judges 443 Pa. 484, 489 (1971). When a judicial or semi-judicial body is equally divided,the subject matter with which it is dealing must remain in status quo. Id.2. The Board finds that the status quo in the instant case is that multi-unit residential structures arenot permitteidn R1A-H districts, and therefore on the Subject Property.3. Chairperson Wrenna Watson voted to approve the proposed development. Board Member KirkBurkley voted to deny the proposed development. The result, where a board consists of twomembers who disagree, is that no majority vote is accomplished and the status quo remains. Asa result, the requested multi-unit residential will be denied.Variances from Sections 911.02, 903.03.D.2, 912.04.C, and 912.04.B1. The Board is specifically empowered by law, Chapter 922 of the Pittsburgh Zoning Code, todecide whether a grant of a variance is appropriate. Pursuant to Section 922.09.E of the Code,the Board is to determine the reasonableness and propriety in each case, prior to the granting ofa variance. However, no variance in the strict application of any provisions of this Zoning Codeshall be granted by the Zoning Board of Adjustment unless it finds that all of the followingconditions exist:a. That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including irregularity,narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional topographical or otherphysical conditions peculiar to the particular property, and that the unnecessary hardshipis due to the conditions, and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by théprovisions of the zoning ordinance in the neighborhood or district in which the property islocated;b. That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no possibility that theproperty can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of the zoning ordinanceand that the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the reasonableuse of the property;c. That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant;d. That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhoodor district in which the property is located, nor substantially or permanently impair the ~appropriate use or development of adjacent property, nor be detrimentat to the publicwelfare; ande. That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance that will afford reliefand will represent the least modification possible of the regulation in issue.. The standards governing the grant of a variance have been established by statutory and case lawand are well settled. The reasons for granting a variance must be substantial, serious andcompelling. As summarized in Valley View Civic Association v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, 501Pa. 555-556, 462 A.2d 637 (Pa. 1983) ‘[t]he party seeking the variance bears the burden. ofproving that: 1) unnecessary hardship will result if the variance is denied; and 2) the proposeduse will not be contrary to the public interest.”. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has held that a less strict standard will be applied where adimensional, rather than a use variance is sought, particularly where an existing structure orbuilding is involved. Hertzberg v. Zoning Board of Adjustment of the City of Pittsburgh, 554 Pa.249, 721 A.2d 43 (Pa. 1998).Dimensional variance requests must establish unnecessary hardship, but are required to meetthe lesser standard that the request is for a “reasonable adjustment of the zoning regulations inorder to utilize the property in a manner consistent with the applicable regulations.” Id. at 257, 47.In determining whether unnecessary hardship has been established in the case of a dimensionalvariance, “courts may consider multiple factors, including the economic cetriment to the applicant —if the variance was denied, the financial hardship created by any work necessary to bring thebuilding into strict compliance with the zoning requirements and the characteristics of thesurrounding neighborhood.” Id. at 264, 50.Board member Burkley finds that Applicant failed to demonstrate unique physical circumstanceson the Subject Property that amounted to an unnecessary hardship:a. Applicant consistently and continuously provides the community with high-qualitydevelopments that are excellently managed and maintained. The Board commendsApplicant's work and commitment to the City.b. However, high-quality work, though appreciated, does not warrant a departure from therequirements of the Code without the proper showing of hardship, inability to conform, andthe minimum request to afford relief.c. The unique shape and situation of the lot relative to the surrounding uses may be .-considered physical circumstances unique to the Subject Property.

That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no possibility that theproperty can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of the zoning ordinanceand that the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the reasonableuse of the property;c. That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant;d. That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhoodor district in which the property is located, nor substantially or permanently impair the ~appropriate use or development of adjacent property, nor be detrimentat to the publicwelfare; ande. That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance that will afford reliefand will represent the least modification possible of the regulation in issue.. The standards governing the grant of a variance have been established by statutory and case lawand are well settled. The reasons for granting a variance must be substantial, serious andcompelling. As summarized in Valley View Civic Association v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, 501Pa. 555-556, 462 A.2d 637 (Pa. 1983) ‘[t]he party seeking the variance bears the burden. ofproving that: 1) unnecessary hardship will result if the variance is denied; and 2) the proposeduse will not be contrary to the public interest.”. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has held that a less strict standard will be applied where adimensional, rather than a use variance is sought, particularly where an existing structure orbuilding is involved. Hertzberg v. Zoning Board of Adjustment of the City of Pittsburgh, 554 Pa.249, 721 A.2d 43 (Pa. 1998).Dimensional variance requests must establish unnecessary hardship, but are required to meetthe lesser standard that the request is for a “reasonable adjustment of the zoning regulations inorder to utilize the property in a manner consistent with the applicable regulations.” Id. at 257, 47.In determining whether unnecessary hardship has been established in the case of a dimensionalvariance, “courts may consider multiple factors, including the economic cetriment to the applicant —if the variance was denied, the financial hardship created by any work necessary to bring thebuilding into strict compliance with the zoning requirements and the characteristics of thesurrounding neighborhood.” Id. at 264, 50.Board member Burkley finds that Applicant failed to demonstrate unique physical circumstanceson the Subject Property that amounted to an unnecessary hardship:a. Applicant consistently and continuously provides the community with high-qualitydevelopments that are excellently managed and maintained. The Board commendsApplicant's work and commitment to the City.b. However, high-quality work, though appreciated, does not warrant a departure from therequirements of the Code without the proper showing of hardship, inability to conform, andthe minimum request to afford relief.c. The unique shape and situation of the lot relative to the surrounding uses may be .-considered physical circumstances unique to the Subject Property. Applicant failed toprovide information sufficient to find that these unique circumstances created anunnecessary hardship so great as to prevent the Subject Property from being developedin conformity with the Code.d. The potential hardship Applicant focused on was economic in nature, which is not acompelling reason to grant a use variance under the Valley View standard.Board member Burkley finds that Applicant failed to demonstrate that the Subject Property cannotbe developed in strict conformity with the Code. Beyond the economic reasons proffered,Applicant did not address why the Subject Property could not be used as single-unit dwellings inconformity with the Code or as two-unit dwellings continuing as lega! nonconforming uses.. Board member Burkley finds that Applicant's request does not represent the minimum variancethat will afford relieve and represent the least modification possible of the regulation in issue:a. Applicant's request for twelve residential units where only one is permitted is a vastdeparture from the intention of the Code and not nearly the ieast modification possible ofthe regulation at issue.. A reasonable request for a multi-residential use with fewer than twelve units may havebeen more palatable given the size of the lot and location of the property:Applicant’s discussion of surrounding commercial uses and the need for a buffer betweenthe residential and commercial zone was apt and garnered ample support, but requestinga variance from the Zoning Board of Adjustment to address the issue seems ill-considered. The Board is not in a position to change the zoning maps and uses permittedby the Code. A more appropriate course of action to address the issue would berequesting zoning map change from the Planning Commission and City Council. If thesurrounding community is in support of this concept the process should be straightforward and easy.. The Board has an obligation to the City and the public to uphold the provisions and theintent of the Code; granting a variance in the instant case would provide an opportunity forother multi-unit residential uses of lower quality than in the instant case to be approved inthe immediate area which would have detrimental impacts on the neighborhood.Further, the Board strives to maintain fairness and consistent in its decisions; similarrequests for variances of such intensity have been denied by this Board in the past, Ininstances where we have granted lesser departures from the zoning code, thosedecisions have been overturned. ;| have given this case great consideration, especially given that it will likely be one of mylast opinions on this Board. | have struggled greatly with this decision and have weighedall-of the relevant factors, including the fact that there will likely be people that aredispleased with this ruling.

The applicant is no doubt a pillar of thecommunity. But the law must be applied equally to all citizens, regardless of whether theyare liked or disliked by their immediate neighbors.

But an important factor in my decision is the extremedeparture of the proposal from what is permitted under the Code. Community support iscertainly important and often persuasive in the granting of dimensional variances andeven minor use variances that comport with the character of the district. But to allowApplicant to build the proposed structure would give them a grossly unfair commercialadvantage over other property owners in the surrounding area and the City of Pittsburghas a whole. There are many property owners around the City that would benefitfinancially by constructing a 12 unit apartment building in a single-family zoning district.But this Board in the past, and presumably in the future, rarely grants such a request, andwe should not do so now. To do so would mean throwing out the Zoning Code andsupplanting it with a system that encourages community favoritism and tyranny of themajority.

Chapter 923 of the Pittsburgh Zoning Code specifically empowers the Board to hear anddecide appeals where it is alleged that there is error in any order, requirement, decision or determinationmade by the Zoning Administrator or the Chief of the Bureau of Building Inspection in the administrationof this Code, and, upon appeal, to interpret any provision of this Code where its meaning or application isin question.2. Pursuant to Section 923.02.B of the Code, the Board is to affirm or reverse or modify,wholly or partly, any order, requirement, decision or determination appealed, and may make such orderas it finds to be proper, as if acting with all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal has beentaken.3. Chapter 914 of the Pittsburgh Zoning Code specifically allows flexibility in addressingvehicle parking, loading and access issues.4. — Section 914.07.G.1 specifically empowers the Zoning Administrator to consider andapprove alternatives to providing off-street parking spaces on the site of the subject development if theapplicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator that the proposed plan will result ina better situation with respect to surrounding neighborhoods, citywide traffic circulation and urban designthan would strict compliance with otherwise applicable off-street parking standards.5. Pursuant to the parking requirements for ""recreations and entertainment’ in Code Section914.02.A, the proposed fitness club must provide 10 parking space to accommodate the up to 50stationary bicycle seats it proposes.6. Club Cycle, LLC met its burden of demonstrating the shared parking for the Atlas Lotsatisfies the standards set forth in Zoning Code Section 914.07.G.1 as follows:A. The location (2315 Wharton Street) of the shared parking spaces is located within onethousand (1,000) feet from the fitness club’s location at 2400 Sidney Street.B. The location of the shared parking is within a UI, Urban Industrial district, a moreintensive zoning classification than R1A-VH, Single-Unit Attached Residential, VeryHigh-Density.C. Club Cycle submitted a parking plan outlining the shared parking agreement, meteredparking spaces and parking garage spaces near the Subject Property that wasapproved by the Zoning Administrator.D. Club Cycle requested a report and recommendation from the Planning Director.£. Club Cycle has requested the form required to record the Shared Parking Agreementwith the County Recorder's Office and has stated it will submit such form.F. Club Cycle has acknowledged that its failure to file the standards set forth will result inthe revocation of a building permit for the Subject Property.7. The Appellants failed to identify or articulate deficiencies under Code Section 914.07.G.1with the Administrator's Exception for shared parking. As shown in the parking plan Club Cyclesubmitted, the shared parking is within the required 1,000 feet and is in a location that has different peakparking demands and different operating hours.8. The Board declines to adopt the Appellants’ interpretation of Section 914.07.G(a)(4) andconcludes that, although the Board may request a report a plan and recommendation from the PlanningDirector where the “planning aspects of the proposed shared parking use” are at issue, that section doesnot require a report from the Planning Director where the Board does not request one.9. The Board appreciates the concerns the Appellants express with regard to the location ofthe Atlas Lot and the potential that Club Cycle patrons may not make use of the parking spaces supplied.However, Club Cycle met to the Code’s objective criteria for the shared parking proposed.Decision: Upon consideration of the testimony and evidence presented, the Appellant'sprotest appeal pursuant to Code Sections 923.02.B.1 and 923.02.D is herebyDENIED. Consistent with its findings of fact and conclusions of law, the Board alsoholds the Zoning Administration’s Exception does not violate the Pittsburgh ZoningCode because Club Cycle satisfied the requirements of Section 914.07.G.1.",True

The Subject Property is located at 308 South Highland Avenue, at the corner of S.Highland Avenue and Alder Street, in a RM-H (Multi-Unit Residential, High-Density) District in theShadyside neighborhood.2. Located on the Subject Property is half of a three-story structure that is divided betweenthe Subject Property and the parcel at 310 S. Highland Avenue. The half of the building on the SubjectProperty is used for four residential units and the half on the 310 S. Highland Avenue parcel is a single-family residence. No internal connection exists between the two halves of the building.3... _ The Applicant proposes to construct decks at the rear of building on the second and thirdfloors, with exterior stairs. As proposed, each deck would be 8.5’ by 11.5’ in size and would be built towithin 6'8” of the exterior side property line on Alder Street, and the stairs would be built to 4’6” from theinterior side property line on second floor and 1 foot from the interior side on the third level.The Zoning Board of Adjustment reserves the right to supplement the decision with Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.4, The Applicant's representative testified that the purpose of the stairs would be to provide apoint of egress on the second floor for the purpose of complying with a fire code requirement, in lieu ofproviding a sprinkler system. The Applicant did not present any evidence of any unique condition of theSubject Property that prevented compliance with the Code’s setback requirements.5. Ann and Peter Haigh, the owners of the other half of the building, at 310 S. HighlandAvenue, presented evidence and testimony in opposition to the requested variances. They explainedthat their bedroom window is proximate to the deck and proposed stairs on the third floor level. Theynoted concerns regarding the potential effects of a deck and stairs in close proximity to their property,including security and potential impacts of noise and smoking. The Board finds the Haighs’ testimony tobe credible.Conclusions of Law:1. The Applicant seeks dimensional variances from Code Section 903.03.D.2, the Code’srequirement for interior and exterior side yard setbacks.2. Pursuant to Section 922.09 of the Code, the Board may grant a variance where it findsthat 1) unique circumstances or conditions of a property would result in in an unnecessary hardship; 2)that the proposed variance would have no adverse effect on the public welfare; and that 3) the proposedvariance is the minimum variance that would afford relief with the least modification possible. Marshall v.City of Philadelphia and Zoning Bd. of Adj., 97 A.3d 323, 329 (Pa. 2014); see also Hertzberg v. ZoningBoard of Adjustment of the City of Pittsburgh, 721 A.2d 43 (Pa. 1998), citing Allegheny West CivicCouncil v. Zoning Bd. of Adj. of the City of Pittsburgh, 689 A.2d 225 (Pa. 1997).3. A party seeking a dimensional variance need not show that a property will be completelyvalueless unless the requested variance is granted and is not required to show that the property cannotbe used in any manner or for any purpose permitted under the zoning ordinance. In considering whetheran applicant has demonstrated an unnecessary hardship, in the context of a dimensional variance, , theBoard may consider multiple ‘factors, including the characteristics of the surrounding neighborhood;whether the denial of the variance will create an economic detriment to the applicant; and theconsequences of requiring strict conformance with the zoning ordinance.4. Although Hertzberg allows for consideration of financial hardship with respect todimensional variances, it does bestow a right to use property for the highest financial gain simplybecause denial of dimensional variance might result in financial “hurt.” See, e.g., Yeager v. ZHB of theCity of Allentown, 779 A.2d 595 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2001); One Meridian Partners v. ZBA of Philadelphia,867 A.2d 706, 710 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2005).5. Here, the Board concludes that the Applicant has not met its legal burden to demonstratean unnecessary hardship necessitating the grant of the requested dimensional variances. The Applicantfailed to present evidence of any unique condition of the Subject Property which prevents compliancewith the Code’s setback requirements. The Applicant acknowledged that the dimensional varianceswere sought because the decks and stairs proposed would be a less expensive alternative to compliancewith fire code requirements. The Applicant did not demonstrate that the potential financial impact wouldoutweigh the significant detrimental impact that could result to the neighboring property.6. The Board concludes that the Haighs’ testimony regarding the potential detrimental impactof granting the requested variance is credible.7. Consistent with the evidence and testimony presented and the applicable legal standardsgoverning dimensional variances, the Board concludes that the requested dimensional variances mustbe denied.Decision: The Applicant's request for variances from Code Section 903.03.D.2 is herebyDENIED.% iée B.

Marshall v.City of Philadelphia and Zoning Bd. of Adj., 97 A.3d 323, 329 (Pa. 2014); see also Hertzberg v. ZoningBoard of Adjustment of the City of Pittsburgh, 721 A.2d 43 (Pa. 1998), citing Allegheny West CivicCouncil v. Zoning Bd. of Adj. of the City of Pittsburgh, 689 A.2d 225 (Pa. 1997).3. A party seeking a dimensional variance need not show that a property will be completelyvalueless unless the requested variance is granted and is not required to show that the property cannotbe used in any manner or for any purpose permitted under the zoning ordinance. In considering whetheran applicant has demonstrated an unnecessary hardship, in the context of a dimensional variance, , theBoard may consider multiple ‘factors, including the characteristics of the surrounding neighborhood;whether the denial of the variance will create an economic detriment to the applicant; and theconsequences of requiring strict conformance with the zoning ordinance.4. Although Hertzberg allows for consideration of financial hardship with respect todimensional variances, it does bestow a right to use property for the highest financial gain simplybecause denial of dimensional variance might result in financial “hurt.” See, e.g., Yeager v. ZHB of theCity of Allentown, 779 A.2d 595 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2001); One Meridian Partners v. ZBA of Philadelphia,867 A.2d 706, 710 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2005).5. Here, the Board concludes that the Applicant has not met its legal burden to demonstratean unnecessary hardship necessitating the grant of the requested dimensional variances. The Applicantfailed to present evidence of any unique condition of the Subject Property which prevents compliancewith the Code’s setback requirements. The Applicant acknowledged that the dimensional varianceswere sought because the decks and stairs proposed would be a less expensive alternative to compliancewith fire code requirements. The Applicant did not demonstrate that the potential financial impact wouldoutweigh the significant detrimental impact that could result to the neighboring property.6. The Board concludes that the Haighs’ testimony regarding the potential detrimental impactof granting the requested variance is credible.7. Consistent with the evidence and testimony presented and the applicable legal standardsgoverning dimensional variances, the Board concludes that the requested dimensional variances mustbe denied.Decision: The Applicant's request for variances from Code Section 903.03.D.2 is herebyDENIED.% iée B.

That the development will not create detrimental transportation impacts, such that theproposed development is determined to adversely affect the safety and convenience ofresidential neighborhoods or of vehicular and pedestrian circulation in the vicinity of thesubject tract; ,C. That the development will not create detrimental transportation impacts, such that theproposed development will result in traffic volumes or circulation patterns that substantiallyexceed the capacity of streets and intersections likely to be used by traffic to and from theproposed development.D. That the development will not create detrimental operational impacts, including potentialimpacts of hours of operation, management of traffic, servicing and loading operations, andany on-site operations associated with the ongoing functions of the use on the site, inconsideration of adjacent and surrounding land uses which may have different sensitivities tosuch operational impacts. : ,E.

Once an applicant for specialexception has established compliance with the specific objective requirements for that exceptionas set forth in the ordinance, the objectors to the proposed special exception have the burden ofpersuasion and the duty to go forward with evidence that the general, ‘nonspecific requirementshave not been fulfilled. Bray v. Zoning Board of Adjustment, 410 A.2d 909 (Pa. Cmwith. 1980).In regard to the Special Exception under Code Section 914.07.G.2(a), the Board finds that theSubject Property has been used for parking in the past, and is an appropriate use for the narrowlot. Further:A. The development will not create any detrimental visual impacts, as the Applicant has:promised to improve and maintain the property.The development will not create any detrimental transportation impacts, such as to adverselyDaffect the safety of members of the surrounding neighborhood.o. The development will not create detrimental transportation impacts, such as traffic volumes orOcirculation patterns that would exceed the street’s capacity.. The development will not create detrimental operational impacts.om The development will not create detrimental health and safety impacts, such as noise,emissions and vibrations. ‘The development will not create detrimental impacts on the future development of parcelsmwithin the vicinity of the Subject Property.O. The development will have no adverse results on property values of neighboring structures.oVariance from Section 903.03.A.1. The Board is specifically empowered by law, Chapter 922 of the Pittsburgh Zoning Code, todecide whether a grant of a variance is appropriate. Pursuant to Section 922.09.E of the Code,the Board is to determine the reasonableness and propriety in each case, prior to the granting ofa variance. However, no variance in the strict application of any provisions of this Zoning Codeshall be granted by the Zoning Board of Adjustment unless it finds that all of the followingconditions exist: .A. That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including irregularity, narrowness,or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditionspeculiar to the particular property, and that the unnecessary hardship is due to the conditions,and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of the zoningordinance in the neighborhood or district in which the property is located;B. That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no possibility that theproperty can be developedi n strict conformity with the provisions of the zoning ordinance andthat the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of theproperty;C. That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant:D. That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood ordistrict in which the property is located, nor substantially or permanently impair theappropriate use or development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare;andE. That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance that will afford relief andwill represent the least modification possible of the regulation in issue.. The standards governing the grant of a variance have long been established by statutory andcase law and are well settled. The reasons for granting a variance must be substantial, seriousand compelling. As summarized in Valley View Civic Association v. Zoning Board of Adjustment,501 Pa. 550, 462 A.2d 637 (1983), “the party seeking the variance bears the burden of provingthat: 1) unnecessary hardship will result if the variance is denied; and 2) the proposed use will notbe contrary to the public interest.” Id.The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has held that a less strict standard will be applied where adimensional, rather than a use variance is sought, particularly where an existing structure or °building is involved. Hertzberg v. Zoning Board of Adjustment of the City of Pittsburgh, 554 Pa.‘249, 721 A.2d 43 (Pa. 1998).Dimensional variance requests must establish unnecessary hardship, but are required to meetthe lesser standard that the request is for a “reasonable adjustment of the zoning regulations inorder to utilize the property in'a manner consistent with the applicable regulations.” Id. 554 Pa. at257, 727 A.2d at 47 (1998).. The Board finds the following:A. The exceptionally narrow lot is a unique physical circumstance that limits development of thelot and creates an undue hardship for the Applicant.B. Due to these conditions, there is no possibility that the Applicant can develop the propertyi nstrict accordance with the Zoning Code.Cc. The unnecessary hardship was not created by the Applicant.D. The variance, if approved, will not alter the essential essence of the surroundingneighborhood. The Applicant will ensure that the aesthetics of the parking pad appearconsistent with that of his personal property, and it will be properly maintained.E. The variance represents the minimum variance that will afford relief.aBURLKEY, KIRK, dissenting.Special Exception 914.07.G.2(a)The proposed use will create detrimental visual impacts on the surrounding area; though the Applicanttestified that the purpose of the project is to develop parking, | am unconvinced that the site will not beused to store construction materials which diminish the aesthetic value of the Subject Property and thesurrounding area. Further, the Applicant failed to address the detrimental transportation impacts causedby the additional parking area’s relation to the street and the pedestrian traffic traveling to and from thesite.Variance from Section 903.03.A . 1The Applicant failed to prove that the proposed site could not be usedi n conformity with the Code; theApplicant stated that the narrow lot limited development but failed to address why this prevented otherpermissible uses on the property. Further, the requested setback of zero feet where thirty feet isrequired is excessive and does not represent the minimum variance that will afford relief.Decision: Chairperson Wrenna Watson voted to approve, and Board Member Kirk Burkleyvoted to deny; therefore, Applicant's request for a variance under Code Section903.03.A.1 and special exception under Code Section 914.01.G.2(a)i s herebyDENIED.FOR.

The development will not create detrimental operational impacts.om The development will not create detrimental health and safety impacts, such as noise,emissions and vibrations. ‘The development will not create detrimental impacts on the future development of parcelsmwithin the vicinity of the Subject Property.O. The development will have no adverse results on property values of neighboring structures.oVariance from Section 903.03.A.1. The Board is specifically empowered by law, Chapter 922 of the Pittsburgh Zoning Code, todecide whether a grant of a variance is appropriate. Pursuant to Section 922.09.E of the Code,the Board is to determine the reasonableness and propriety in each case, prior to the granting ofa variance. However, no variance in the strict application of any provisions of this Zoning Codeshall be granted by the Zoning Board of Adjustment unless it finds that all of the followingconditions exist: .A. That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including irregularity, narrowness,or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditionspeculiar to the particular property, and that the unnecessary hardship is due to the conditions,and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of the zoningordinance in the neighborhood or district in which the property is located;B. That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no possibility that theproperty can be developedi n strict conformity with the provisions of the zoning ordinance andthat the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of theproperty;C. That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant:D. That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood ordistrict in which the property is located, nor substantially or permanently impair theappropriate use or development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare;andE. That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance that will afford relief andwill represent the least modification possible of the regulation in issue.. The standards governing the grant of a variance have long been established by statutory andcase law and are well settled. The reasons for granting a variance must be substantial, seriousand compelling. As summarized in Valley View Civic Association v. Zoning Board of Adjustment,501 Pa. 550, 462 A.2d 637 (1983), “the party seeking the variance bears the burden of provingthat: 1) unnecessary hardship will result if the variance is denied; and 2) the proposed use will notbe contrary to the public interest.” Id.The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has held that a less strict standard will be applied where adimensional, rather than a use variance is sought, particularly where an existing structure or °building is involved. Hertzberg v. Zoning Board of Adjustment of the City of Pittsburgh, 554 Pa.‘249, 721 A.2d 43 (Pa. 1998).Dimensional variance requests must establish unnecessary hardship, but are required to meetthe lesser standard that the request is for a “reasonable adjustment of the zoning regulations inorder to utilize the property in'a manner consistent with the applicable regulations.” Id. 554 Pa. at257, 727 A.2d at 47 (1998).. The Board finds the following:A. The exceptionally narrow lot is a unique physical circumstance that limits development of thelot and creates an undue hardship for the Applicant.B. Due to these conditions, there is no possibility that the Applicant can develop the propertyi nstrict accordance with the Zoning Code.Cc. The unnecessary hardship was not created by the Applicant.D. The variance, if approved, will not alter the essential essence of the surroundingneighborhood. The Applicant will ensure that the aesthetics of the parking pad appearconsistent with that of his personal property, and it will be properly maintained.E. The variance represents the minimum variance that will afford relief.aBURLKEY, KIRK, dissenting.Special Exception 914.07.G.2(a)The proposed use will create detrimental visual impacts on the surrounding area; though the Applicanttestified that the purpose of the project is to develop parking, | am unconvinced that the site will not beused to store construction materials which diminish the aesthetic value of the Subject Property and thesurrounding area. Further, the Applicant failed to address the detrimental transportation impacts causedby the additional parking area’s relation to the street and the pedestrian traffic traveling to and from thesite.Variance from Section 903.03.A . 1The Applicant failed to prove that the proposed site could not be usedi n conformity with the Code; theApplicant stated that the narrow lot limited development but failed to address why this prevented otherpermissible uses on the property. Further, the requested setback of zero feet where thirty feet isrequired is excessive and does not represent the minimum variance that will afford relief.Decision: Chairperson Wrenna Watson voted to approve, and Board Member Kirk Burkleyvoted to deny; therefore, Applicant's request for a variance under Code Section903.03.A.1 and special exception under Code Section 914.01.G.2(a)i s herebyDENIED.FOR.

Chapter 923 of the Pittsburgh Zoning Code specifically empowerthse Board to hear anddecide appeals where it is alleged that there is error in any order, requirement, decision or determinationmade by the Zoning Administrator or the Chief of the Bureau of Building Inspection in the administrationof this Code, and, upon appeal, to interpret any provision of this Code where its meaning or application isin question. .17. Pursuant to Section 923.02.B of the Code, the Board is to affirm or reverse or modify,wholly or partly, any order, requirement, decision or determination appealed, and may make such orderas it finds to be proper, as if acting with all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal has beentaken.18. Pursuant to the development standards for EMI district in Code Section 905.03.C, landwithin an EMI district shall be subject to the Residential Compatibility standards of Section 916.‘ 19. Because the Subject Property is located across the street from an R2-M zoning district,Section 916 imposes a 15-foot exterior side setback on the Subject Property; the requirements of Section916 apply to primary and accessory uses. The proposed transformer has less than a 15-foot sidesetback from the Cypress Street side.20. ° However, Section 925.06.A specifically permits certain structures and features within therequired setbacks, regardless of the requirements of the Residential Compatibility Standards of Section916. Section 925.06.A.11 permits “utility lines, wires and associated structures, such as power poles...”within the setbacks.21. UPMC Shadyside met its burden of demonstrating that the transformer satisfies thestandards set forth in Zoning Code Section 922.04.E.6(g), as follows:A. The electrical service would be routed from the transformer to the garage by means ofunderground lines.B. The transformer, within a protective cabinet, would not be visible from the property linebecause it will be screened with a six-foot fence and gate surrounded on three sidesby six-foot evergreen trees.Decision: Upon consideration of the testimony and evidence presented, including theadditional evidence submitted pursuant to the motion of the Appellant, BloomfieldCitizens’ Council, the Appellant’s protest appeal pursuant to Code Sections923.02.B.1 and 923.02.D is hereby denied as being untimely because it was filedmore than 30 days after the Appellant was aware or should have been aware of thelocation of the proposed transformer. Consistent with its findings of fact andconclusions of law, the Board also holds that UPMC Shadyside has a vested rightin the City-issued approvals and permits. UPMC Shadyside may thus proceed withthe installation of the transformer at the identified Cypress Street location,consistent with the approved site development plans.Alice B.

The Subject Property is comprised of two parcels and a portion of a third parcel, atthe intersection of Butler Street and McCandless Avenue, in Upper Lawrenceville. As combined,the site would have an L-shape.2. Parcel No. 119-S-152, with the street address of 5303 Butler Street, has dimensionsof 430’ by 100’ (43,000 sf), with its 430’ length on Butler Street (“Butler Street Parcel”). BerlinWay extends along the rear of the Butler Street Parcel. The Butler Street Parcel has been vacantsince 1938 and has been used for surface parking.The Zoning Board of Adjustment reserves the right to supplement the decision with Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.3. Parcel No. 80-D-1, located at the corner of Butler Street and McCandless Street,abuts the Butler Street Parcel. Its dimensions are 30’ by 100’ (3,000 sf) and a historic firehousestructure is located on that parcel (“Firehouse Parcel.”). The height of the firehouse structure isapproximately 35’.4. Parcel No. 119-S-240, with frontage on McCandless Street, is located on theopposite side of Berlin Way from the Firehouse Parcel. The entire area of that existing parcel isapproximately 5.1 acres and it extends to 54th Street. The Applicant proposes to subdivide ParcelNo. 119-S-240 and to include a 98’ by 353’ (34,594 sf) portion of that parcel in the developmentsite (“McCandless Avenue Parcel”). The 353’ length of the development parcel would extendalong McCandless Avenue.5. Located on the remainder of the McCandless Avenue Parcel is an office andwarehouse, with the street address of 5301 Butler Street. That use would continue.6. A surface parking lot, which is associated with the office use, has access from ButlerStreet through the Butler Street Parcel and from McCandless Avenue on Berlin Way, between theFirehouse Parcel and the McCandless Avenue Parcel.7. The Butler Street Parcel and the Firehouse Parcel are within a RIV-MU (RiverfrontMixed-Use) District and the McCandless Avenue Parcel is within a RIV-IMU (Riverfront IndustrialMixed-Use District) District.8. The portion of the McCandless Avenue Parcel that would be included in theproposed development site has been vacant since at least 2006, when its use for vehicular accessfor a prior truck terminal use was discontinued.9. Warehouses and smaller industrial office uses are located toward the rear of theproposed development site.10. Located on the opposite side of Butler Street are a number of commercial uses,within the Butler Street LNC (Local Neighborhood Commercial) District. An R1A-VH (Single UnitAttached Residential, Very High Density) District is located behind the properties in the LNCDistrict.• Proposed Development11. The Applicant proposes to construct an L-shaped building on the Butler Street andthe development portion of McCandless Avenue Parcel.12. As proposed, the structure would extend to the Butler Street and McCandlessAvenue property lines, with 0’ setbacks.13. The height proposed for the new building is 5-stories/72’-6”. The fifth story of theproposed structure would be set back 12’ from the Butler Street property line and from theFirehouse Parcel. The intent of the proposed stepbacks for the upper story is to limit the visualimpact of the proposed height of the new building.14. Wood framing would be used for the upper four floors of the proposed structure.215. The uses the Applicant proposes for the new building include 300 residential units;and 9,339 sf of first floor commercial space.16. The Applicant intends to provide a total of 30 units to tenants with an income of 50%AMI.17. The Applicant proposes to provide 200 vehicle parking spaces in first floor parkingareas at the rear of the building on both sides of the drive aisle on the Butler Street Parcel andalong the rear of the building on the McCandless Avenue Parcel. Approximately 100 bicycleparking spaces are also to be provided.18. Access to the parking areas would be by means of drive aisles/curb cuts from ButlerStreet and from McCandless Avenue.19. The upper floors of the proposed building would extend over the Butler Street andMcCandless Avenue drive aisles. The drive aisles would also provide access to the parking areafor the existing warehouse use.20. Because of the need to provide sufficient clearance for the drive aisles, the proposedheight of the first floor of the building is 18’.21. As part of the development project, the Applicant also intends to restore thefirehouse. Uses intended for that structure include 2,100 sf of retail space and a public dog washarea.• Evidence In Support Of The Proposed Relief22. Project architect, Paul Alessandro, described the current conditions on the site, thecomponents of the proposed development project and the project design.23. Mr. Alessandro provided a series of renderings that represent different views ofthe proposed development from Butler Street and McCandless Avenue.24. Mr. Alessandro explained that the massing of the proposed structure, with the 12’stepback from Butler Street for the fifth story, is intended to limit the impact of the height on theButler Street streetscape.25. Mr. Alessandro asserted that the floors of the proposed building must be of auniform height to comply with International Building Code Standards for wood-frame structures.26. Mr. Alessandro submitted a shadow study that is intended to depict the effect ofthe proposed structure on surrounding properties and Butler Street at different times of day andyear.27. Andrew Yule, a representative of the developer, asserted that the dimensions ofthe site, as created with the developer’s proposed combination of the parcels, and the locationof the firehouse are unique characteristics of the site that limit how the site can be used incompliance with the Code’s dimensional standards.328. Mr. Yule described a study of the feasibility of alternative uses for the site,including hotel, office, industrial, retail, and lower-density residential uses. The study concludedthat, based on market conditions and the physical characteristics of the Subject Property, ahigh-density multi-unit residential development is the only use for the site that would be feasible.29. Mr. Yule also submitted a study of the economic feasibility of developing a multi-unit residential building on the site that incorporates the restoration of the firehouse and theintended inclusion of affordable units. The study concluded that the proposed height and densityare the minimum necessary to obtain financing for construction.• Community Participation30. Dave Breingan, on behalf of Lawrenceville United, and Kara Kimicata, on behalf ofLawrenceville Corporation, appeared at the hearing to describe the community’s considerationof the proposed building. Mr. Breingan noted that a building of contiguous height is preferableto one with varying heights. Mr. Breingan also noted the strong community support for thepreservation and adaptive reuse of the historic firehouse building. Ms. Kimicata concurred withthese comments.31. On behalf of their organizations, Mr. Breingan and Ms. Kimicata presented a jointletter of support for the proposal, subject to the following conditions:• All eligible housing units, and minimally, all inclusionary units, will acceptHousing Choice Vouchers;• The development will comply with the guidelines outlined in the ButlerStreet Design Guidelines plan, including installation of bump outs atButler Street/McCandless Avenue and Butler Street/53rd Street and a busshelter;• The dog park will be made accessible to the public during the hours thatit is open, with appropriate signage; and• The development team must work with the community groups to establisha construction mitigation plan before construction commences tominimize disruptions to the Persad Center and other stakeholders.32. Brian Broad, the owner of a business at 5262 Butler Street, Michael Boyle, theowner of a property at 5314 Butler Street, Vlad Kaplan, representing Pro Housing Pittsburgh,appeared at the hearing to support the request.33. No one appeared at the hearing to oppose the request.34. The Applicant provided proposed finding of fact and conclusions of law to theBoard on February 24, 2023, and the record closed as of the date.Conclusions of Law:41. Section 905.04.E.3 sets forth the height requirements for structures in the RIVDistrict, with different limitations applicable to RIV-MU and RIV-IMU Districts, consistent with theadopted RIV Height Map.2. Pursuant to different types of “Performance Points,” set forth in Sections905.04.K.1 and 915.07, where permitted in the RIV Height Map, the permitted height of astructure may be increased.3. Assuming compliance with certain Performance Points requirements, a structure inthe portion of the proposed development site on the McCandless Avenue Parcel, in the RIV-IMUDistrict, could be permitted by right to a height of 7-stories/90’.4. The permitted height of a structure on the Butler Street Parcel, in the RIV-MUDistrict, is limited to 3-stories/45’.5. The Applicant here proposes an L-shaped building, with a portion on theMcCandless Avenue Parcel, in a RIV-IMU District, and a portion on the Butler Street Parcel, in aRIV-MU District, and with a uniform building height of 5-stories/72’-6”. As proposed, the fifthstory of the portion of the structure on the Butler Street parcel would be stepped back 12’ fromboth the Butler Street property line and the Firehouse Parcel.6. To accommodate the uniform 5-story/72’-6” height proposed, the Applicant seeksa dimensional variance from Section 905.04.E.3 and the RIV Height Map, for the portion of theproposed building on the Butler Street Parcel, in the RIV-MU District.7. Section 922.09.E sets forth the general conditions the Board is to consider withrespect to variances. The criteria for determining whether to grant a variance include: 1)whether unique circumstances or conditions of a property would result in an unnecessaryhardship; 2) whether the property could be developed in accordance with the Code’srequirements to allow for its reasonable use; 3) whether the applicant created the hardship; 4)whether the requested variance would adversely affect the essential character of theneighborhood or the public welfare; and 5) whether the variance requested is the minimumvariance that would afford relief with the least modification possible. See Marshall v. City ofPhiladelphia and Zoning Bd. of Adj., 97 A.3d 323, 329 (Pa. 2014); Hertzberg v. Zoning Board ofAdj. of the City of Pittsburgh, 721 A.2d 43 (Pa. 1998), citing Allegheny West Civic Council v.Zoning Bd. of Adj. of the City of Pittsburgh, 689 A.2d 225 (Pa. 1997); see also Metal Green Inc.v. City of Philadelphia, 266 A.3d 495, 510 (Pa. 2021).8. In determining whether unnecessary hardship has been established with regard todimensional variances, the Board may consider multiple factors, including the economicdetriment to the applicant if the variance is denied, the financial hardship created by any worknecessary to bring the building into strict compliance with the zoning requirements and thecharacteristics of the surrounding neighborhood. See Hertzberg, 721 A.2d at 260.9. An applicant seeking a use variance is not required to demonstrate that theproperty would be valueless without a requested variance. Id.10. Here, the Applicant created the irregular shape of the proposed development site,with the different RIV Districts. However, the existence of the historic firehouse and the intent topreserve it as part of the development project are unique conditions of the site.511. The Applicant also demonstrated that the effect of the differing heightrequirements for the RIV-IMU and the RIV-MU create construction and cost challenges todevelopment of the vacant site.12. The uniform 5-story/72’-6” height proposed for the building, with the 12’ setbackproposed for the fifth story on Butler Street Parcel, reflects a reasonable compromise betweenthe maximum height that could be permitted on the McCandless Avenue Parcel and the heightlimitation on the Butler Street Parcel.13. For these reasons, consistent with the evidence and testimony presented, and theapplicable legal standards governing dimensional variances, the Board concludes that approvalof the request to allow a maximum uniform height of 5-stories/72’-6” height and a variance forthe portion of the proposed structure on the Butler Street Parcel is appropriate.14. The Board does not have jurisdiction to impose all of the conditions thatLawrenceville United and Lawrenceville Corporation have suggested. Because the Applicantagreed to the requested conditions, they are included in the decision below.6Decision: Consistent with the foregoing findings of fact and conclusions of law, theApplicant’s request for approval of a maximum uniform height of 5-stories/72’-6” height and a height variance for the portion of the proposed structure onthe Butler Street Parcel is APPROVED, subject to these conditions:1. The building design shall include stepbacks of not less than 10‘ fromButler Street and the Firehouse Parcel, as depicted in applicant’s plans;2. The historic firehouse shall be restored and retained as part of thedevelopment, as described;3. All eligible housing units will accept Housing Choice Vouchers;4. The development shall comply with the guidelines outlined in the ButlerStreet Design Guidelines plan, including the installation of bump outs atButler Street/McCandless Avenue and Butler Street/53rd Street, and theprovision of a bus shelter;5.

The Subject Propertyi s located at 7233 Lemington Avenuei n an R1D-L (Residential One-Unit Detached: Low Density) Districti n Lincoln Flemington Belmar.2. A two-story house is located on the Subject Property. ;3. The Applicant proposes to use the house for a child care facility for between 15 and 20 -children. :4. The Applicant indicated that the intended hours of operation for the child care facilitywould be 24 hours per day, Monday through Saturday.5. The Applicante xplained that, for children who are to stay overnight at the facility, thefacility would provide transportation for those children and that guardians would not pick up or drop off- the children.; 6. The Applicant stated that on-street parking is typically available in the immediate vicinity ofthe Subject Property and that, during the day, children could be picked up and dropped off at the rear ofthe Subject Property, on Somerset Street.The Zoning Board of Adjustment reserves the'right to supplement the decision with Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.7. The Applicant also noted her intent to comply with all of the licensing and otherrequirements of the Commonwealth Department of Human Services.8. No parties appeared at the hearing to oppose the request.Conclusions of Law:1. Pursuant to Code Section 911.02, the “child care” use is defined as “an establishment thatprovides care, protection and supervision for children on a regular basis away from their primaryresidence for less than 24 hours per day.” The “child care (limited)” use is for 4 to 6 children.at any one""time and the “child care (general)” use is for 7 or more children at any one time. Pursuant to Section911.02, the child care (limited) use is permitted in R1 Districts as a special exception, but the child care(general) use is not permitted in R1 Districts.2. Code Section 911.04.A.12 sets forth the specific: criteria that the Board is to consider withregard to a request for a special exception for the child care use in R1 Districts, as permitted, including.whether the use would create detrimental impacts on surrounding properties, taking into accountprobable generation of traffic, parking needs, noise generation and hours of operation. The Board is alsoto consider whether outdoor play areas are sufficiently enclosed and screened; and whether signage is:proposed.3. Here, the Applicant seeks approval for a child care facility for as many as 20 children in anR1D District, where the child care (general) is not permitted. The request must thus be considered as arequest for a variance and not for a special exception. ‘ :4. The. Applicant presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the site is uniquelysituated and that, consistent with the criteria for the permitted child care (limited) use, the proposed usewould not have a significantly greater impact than a child care (limited) facility.
